Ansible Day 1:
==============
Configuration management tool
Push Mechanism
Ansible default fs path /etc/ansible
Host Inventory  and Ansible Configuration file

pageant
======== 
- open-source tool download (64-bit / 32-bit)
ppk files repository

Benefits:
=========
-> Very Easy to Learn and implement
-> Primary tool - adoption
-> Open-Source
-> On-Premises / Cloud-premises
-> yaml / unix commands

Programming Languages:
======================
yaml
unix

Limitations:
============
Master - cannot Install and runs in the Windows machine
Single Master Configuration
Master - Control Node
Slaves - Managed Nodes

Charteristics of Ansible:
==========================
Agentless Architecture
Master - Slaves Ip =>> Host Inventory 
Slaves - Master IP - No need to Configure

4. Ansible Replacement:
========================
-> chef - pull
-> puppet - pull
-> salt - push / pull
-> Ansible 70% Industry adoption

Installation:
=============
Master - ansible, python
Slaves - Python

#! /bin/bash
yum update
yum install python-pip -y
pip install ansible

#! /bin/bash
yum update
yum install python-pip -y

Check:
======

httpd install:
ansible all -i hosts -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present" -b
ansible all -i hosts -m service -a "name=httpd state=started" -b
ansible all -i hosts -m ping
ansible all -i hosts -a "date"
ansible all -i hosts -a "yum install mysql -y"
ansible all -i slaves.txt --module-name copy --args "src=/home/ec2-user/test dest=/tmp" -b

Ansible config file:
====================
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/stable-2.11/examples/ansible.cfg

Ansible Concepts:
=================
   adhoc    -  single task exec
   Playbook -  Multitask exec
   vault    -  Encrypt
   roles    - offline template - bundles of an playbooks - ansible galaxy
